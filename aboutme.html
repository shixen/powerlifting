                <P>Hello im Niklas and im a certified personal trainer and i have about ten years of experience working
                    out in the gym.
                    about 5 years in to it i decided to take it a step further since i fell in love with the sport and
                    felt like i want to
                    help others do the same.</P>
                <p>So i went to Sportclub Education in Stockholm Sweden to sudy and become a personal trainer
                    and i have now worked in a gym for almost 6 years with both personal training and group exercise
                    classes and i love it.
                </p>
                <p> I quickly became obsessed with powerlifting movements Squat , Bench press and Deadlift since they
                    are very tecnical movements
                    and require alot of practise to master.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Do you have something that you want to improve ? Mabye powerlifting ? or stability training ? or
                    even just
                    want to know about the gym and working out in general ? i can help you with that!
                </p>
