                <p>Beeing physically active improves more then you might think. </p>
                <p>Exercising regularly can help prevent weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood
                    pressure.
                    Bone strengthening exercise like jumping, running, or lifting weights can help keep bones strong.
                    Exercise can help a person age well. This may not seem important now, but your body will thank you
                    later
                    especially when your older.

                    <h2>Squat</h2>
                    <p>Perform barbell squats by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.
                        Take a deep breath and unrack a weighted barbell, holding it on your upper back.
                        Keep your chest up and your back straight as you hinge your hips and knees to lower your body
                        through a full range of motion into a squat position.</p>

                    <h2>Bench Press</h2>
                    <p>It involves lying on a bench
                        and pressing weight upward using
                        either a barbell or a pair of dumbbells.
                        During a bench press, you lower the weight
                        down to chest level and then press upwards
                        while extending your arms. This movement is
                        considered one repetition, or rep.</p>

                    <h2>Deadlift</h2>
                    <p>The deadlift is a strengthening exercise where a loaded barbell is lifted off the ground from a
                        stabilized,
                        bent over position, knees free to bend.
                        It is one of the three canonical powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.
